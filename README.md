# SynMapper
`SynMapper` is a specialized repository designed to leverage **self-supervised learning** techniques applied to a large-scale dataset of unmapped chemical reactions. Its primary objective is to learn meaningful molecular transformations without explicit atom-mapping annotations. Following the initial **self-supervised learning**, `SynMapper` fine-tunes its models on downstream tasks involving the *Imaginary Transition State* (ITS) graph representation, enabling accurate prediction of atom-atom mappings.
